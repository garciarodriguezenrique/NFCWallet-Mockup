# NFCWalltet-Mockup
Mockup NFC wallet aplication developed for educational purposes.

The main objective pursued when development started was to better understand the inner operative of Mifare tags (especially Mifare Classic) at a low level and to exemplify several typical attacks on Mifare tags. Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 it was not possible to test some of the mentioned attacks on legitemate readers, thus the need of coding this application to grasp how these attacks would work.

The application is essentially bare-bones as it is, and in it's current state it's prone to errors outside of the contemplated use cases. If you need part o the code for your own projects, by all means use it. However, the code might be hard to adapt and even though it cannot be considered to be weaponized in any manner, remember that it was designed with educational purposes. I'm not responsible for the misuse of any of the material contained in this repository.
